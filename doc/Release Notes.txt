Data Extract Changes:

Overview:

Data Extract did not take v3.12 Key Column changes in C3D into affect for “Other Labs” views.  
Five columns were added to the Key Columns in the OC Glib, and could not be reflected in the 
definitions for “Other Labs” views because these labs are dynamically created during the 
“Add New Study” process.  The column definitions are hard-coded.


“Other Labs” views are still generated by the “Add New Study” (EXTSET01), but are generated differently 
based upon the version of Theradex being used.  To accommodate this, VERSION needed to be 
passed to the procedure P_GEN_LAB_OTH_VW_TEXT and P_CRT_STUDY_VW.   
Within the P_GEN_LAB_OTH_VW_TEXT procedure, version controls how the views are defined.  

On the EXTSET02 form the call to the procedure P_CRT_STUDY_VW does not require a version, 
because it is not going to re-generate the view definitions.
